## Alert Detail



### [ Big Redirect Detected (Potential Sensitive Information Leak) ](https://www.zaproxy.org/docs/alerts/10044/)



##### Low (Medium)

### Description

The server has responded with a redirect that seems to provide a large response. This may indicate that although the server sent a redirect it also responded with body content (which may include sensitive details, PII, etc.).

* URL: http://127.0.0.1:8000/produtos
  * Node Name: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/produtos ()(_token,descricao,nome,preco)`
  * Method: `POST`
  * Parameter: ``
  * Attack: ``
  * Evidence: ``
  * Other Info: `Location header URI length: 30 [http://127.0.0.1:8000/produtos].
Predicted response size: 330.
Response Body Length: 366.`


Instances: 1

### Solution

Ensure that no sensitive information is leaked via redirect responses. Redirect responses should have almost no content.

### [ Cookie No HttpOnly Flag ](https://www.zaproxy.org/docs/alerts/10010/)



##### Low (Medium)

### Description

A cookie has been set without the HttpOnly flag, which means that the cookie can be accessed by JavaScript. If a malicious script can be run on this page then the cookie will be accessible and can be transmitted to another site. If this is a session cookie then session hijacking may be possible.

* URL: http://127.0.0.1:8000/
  * Node Name: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`
  * Method: `GET`
  * Parameter: `XSRF-TOKEN`
  * Attack: ``
  * Evidence: `Set-Cookie: XSRF-TOKEN`
  * Other Info: ``
* URL: http://127.0.0.1:8000/produtos
  * Node Name: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/produtos`
  * Method: `GET`
  * Parameter: `XSRF-TOKEN`
  * Attack: ``
  * Evidence: `Set-Cookie: XSRF-TOKEN`
  * Other Info: ``
* URL: http://127.0.0.1:8000/produtos%3Fq=ZAP
  * Node Name: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/produtos (q)`
  * Method: `GET`
  * Parameter: `XSRF-TOKEN`
  * Attack: ``
  * Evidence: `Set-Cookie: XSRF-TOKEN`
  * Other Info: ``
* URL: http://127.0.0.1:8000/produtos

#### CWE Id: [ 1004 ](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/1004.html)


#### WASC Id: 13

#### Source ID: 3

### [ Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy Header Missing or Invalid ](https://www.zaproxy.org/docs/alerts/90004/)



##### Low (Medium)

### Description

Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy header is an opt-in header designed to counter side-channels attacks like Spectre. Resource should be specifically set as shareable amongst different origins.

* URL: http://127.0.0.1:8000/robots.txt
  * Node Name: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/robots.txt`
  * Method: `GET`
  * Parameter: `Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy`
  * Attack: ``
  * Evidence: ``
  * Other Info: ``


Instances: 1

### Solution

Ensure that the application/web server sets the Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy header appropriately, and that it sets the Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy header to 'same-origin' for all web pages.
'same-site' is considered as less secured and should be avoided.
If resources must be shared, set the header to 'cross-origin'.
If possible, ensure that the end user uses a standards-compliant and modern web browser that supports the Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy header (https://caniuse.com/mdn-http_headers_cross-origin-resource-policy).

#### CWE Id: [ 693 ](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/693.html)


#### WASC Id: 14

#### Source ID: 3

### [ X-Content-Type-Options Header Missing ](https://www.zaproxy.org/docs/alerts/10021/)



##### Low (Medium)

### Description

The Anti-MIME-Sniffing header X-Content-Type-Options was not set to 'nosniff'. This allows older versions of Internet Explorer and Chrome to perform MIME-sniffing on the response body, potentially causing the response body to be interpreted and displayed as a content type other than the declared content type. Current (early 2014) and legacy versions of Firefox will use the declared content type (if one is set), rather than performing MIME-sniffing.

* URL: http://127.0.0.1:8000/robots.txt
  * Node Name: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/robots.txt`
  * Method: `GET`
  * Parameter: `x-content-type-options`
  * Attack: ``
  * Evidence: ``
  * Other Info: `This issue still applies to error type pages (401, 403, 500, etc.) as those pages are often still affected by injection issues, in which case there is still concern for browsers sniffing pages away from their actual content type.
At "High" threshold this scan rule will not alert on client or server error responses.`


Instances: 1

### Solution

Ensure that the application/web server sets the Content-Type header appropriately, and that it sets the X-Content-Type-Options header to 'nosniff' for all web pages.
If possible, ensure that the end user uses a standards-compliant and modern web browser that does not perform MIME-sniffing at all, or that can be directed by the web application/web server to not perform MIME-sniffing.

### [ Non-Storable Content ](https://www.zaproxy.org/docs/alerts/10049/)



##### Informational (Medium)

### Description

The response contents are not storable by caching components such as proxy servers. If the response does not contain sensitive, personal or user-specific information, it may benefit from being stored and cached, to improve performance.

* URL: http://127.0.0.1:8000/
  * Node Name: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`
  * Method: `GET`
  * Parameter: ``

  * Method: `POST`
  * Parameter: ``
  * Attack: ``
  * Evidence: `private`
  * Other Info: ``


Instances: 5

### Solution

The content may be marked as storable by ensuring that the following conditions are satisfied:
The request method must be understood by the cache and defined as being cacheable ("GET", "HEAD", and "POST" are currently defined as cacheable)
The response status code must be understood by the cache (one of the 1XX, 2XX, 3XX, 4XX, or 5XX response classes are generally understood)
The "no-store" cache directive must not appear in the request or response header fields
For caching by "shared" caches such as "proxy" caches, the "private" response directive must not appear in the response
For caching by "shared" caches such as "proxy" caches, the "Authorization" header field must not appear in the request, unless the response explicitly allows it (using one of the "must-revalidate", "public", or "s-maxage" Cache-Control response directives)
In addition to the conditions above, at least one of the following conditions must also be satisfied by the response:
It must contain an "Expires" header field
It must contain a "max-age" response directive
For "shared" caches such as "proxy" caches, it must contain a "s-maxage" response directive
It must contain a "Cache Control Extension" that allows it to be cached
It must have a status code that is defined as cacheable by default (200, 203, 204, 206, 300, 301, 404, 405, 410, 414, 501).

### [ Session Management Response Identified ](https://www.zaproxy.org/docs/alerts/10112/)



##### Informational (Medium)

### Description

The given response has been identified as containing a session management token. The 'Other Info' field contains a set of header tokens that can be used in the Header Based Session Management Method. If the request is in a context which has a Session Management Method set to "Auto-Detect" then this rule will change the session management to use the tokens identified.

### [ Storable and Cacheable Content ](https://www.zaproxy.org/docs/alerts/10049/)



##### Informational (Medium)

### Description

The response contents are storable by caching components such as proxy servers, and may be retrieved directly from the cache, rather than from the origin server by the caching servers, in response to similar requests from other users. If the response data is sensitive, personal or user-specific, this may result in sensitive information being leaked. In some cases, this may even result in a user gaining complete control of the session of another user, depending on the configuration of the caching components in use in their environment. This is primarily an issue where "shared" caching servers such as "proxy" caches are configured on the local network. This configuration is typically found in corporate or educational environments, for instance.

* URL: http://127.0.0.1:8000/robots.txt
  * Node Name: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/robots.txt`
  * Method: `GET`
  * Parameter: ``
  * Attack: ``
  * Evidence: ``
  * Other Info: `In the absence of an explicitly specified caching lifetime directive in the response, a liberal lifetime heuristic of 1 year was assumed. This is permitted by rfc7234.`


Instances: 1

### Solution

Validate that the response does not contain sensitive, personal or user-specific information. If it does, consider the use of the following HTTP response headers, to limit, or prevent the content being stored and retrieved from the cache by another user:
Cache-Control: no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate, private
Pragma: no-cache
Expires: 0
This configuration directs both HTTP 1.0 and HTTP 1.1 compliant caching servers to not store the response, and to not retrieve the response (without validation) from the cache, in response to a similar request.

### [ User Agent Fuzzer ](https://www.zaproxy.org/docs/alerts/10104/)



##### Informational (Medium)

### Description

Check for differences in response based on fuzzed User Agent (eg. mobile sites, access as a Search Engine Crawler). Compares the response statuscode and the hashcode of the response body with the original response.

### [ User Controllable HTML Element Attribute (Potential XSS) ](https://www.zaproxy.org/docs/alerts/10031/)



##### Informational (Low)

### Description

This check looks at user-supplied input in query string parameters and POST data to identify where certain HTML attribute values might be controlled. This provides hot-spot detection for XSS (cross-site scripting) that will require further review by a security analyst to determine exploitability.

* URL: http://127.0.0.1:8000/produtos%3Fq=ZAP
  * Node Name: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/produtos (q)`
  * Method: `GET`
  * Parameter: `q`
  * Attack: ``
  * Evidence: ``
  * Other Info: `User-controlled HTML attribute values were found. Try injecting special characters to see if XSS might be possible. The page at the following URL:

http://127.0.0.1:8000/produtos?q=ZAP

appears to include user input in:
a(n) [input] tag [value] attribute

The user input found was:
q=ZAP
